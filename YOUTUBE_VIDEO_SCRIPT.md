INTRO

Are you an Android developer stuck waiting weeks to find testers? 

Google Play requires 20 real users to opt into your closed test for 14 days before you can go live.

But here's the problem: Finding those testers is a nightmare.

Today, I'm showing you how to get verified testers in 24 hours instead of 24 weeks.

THE PROBLEM

If you've tried recruiting testers before, you know this is hard.

First, it's incredibly slow. You post on freelance sites, Reddit, Discord... and wait. Days go by. Weeks go by. You might get 5 testers. Maybe 10 if you're lucky. All while your launch gets pushed back.

Second, there's the fake accounts problem. You don't know if these people actually have real Google Play accounts. Google can flag your app for suspicious activity. That's a compliance nightmare.

Third, it's expensive. Bounty boards charge 30-40% fees. You end up paying way more than the testers actually get.

And worst of all, you never know if they actually tested your app or just took the money.

THE SOLUTION

Meet TestForPay.

We didn't build TestForPay to compete with anyone. We built it because we saw a real problem. Developers everywhere were struggling to find testers, wasting weeks, taking compliance risks, and paying too much. We knew there had to be a better way.

So we created TestForPay to solve that specific problem. To make Google Play testing simple, fast, and safe.

We built TestForPay to solve all of this.

Here's how it works:

You post your testing job. Add your app details, your Google Play closed test link, and your budget.

Real testers apply. These aren't robots. They're real people with real Google Play accounts who opt into your closed test directly through Google Play.

You get 20+ testers in 24 hours. On average, you'll have your full roster of verified testers within a day.

You track everything in real-time. See which testers opted in, who's actively testing, get screenshots and feedback. Our dashboard shows live engagement metrics: app launches, features tested, session data, and more.

Testers submit detailed feedback with screenshots. You collect real usage data and ratings through our built-in feedback system.

After 14 days, you export your testing report. TestForPay automatically generates a comprehensive report with recruitment metrics, engagement data, tester feedback, and compliance verification. Perfect for your Google Play production access application.

You publish and you're done. You've met all Google's requirements and your app goes live.
